  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Succulent chicken plus ultra-savory, crispy skin means you have a guaranteed game day hit on your hands. These oven-crisped Garlic-Parmesan Wings offer incredible flavor without the hassle of deep-frying. Coated in garlic and Parmesan cheese, they’re a mouthwatering alternative to a traditional, sauced Buffalo wing. For a chicken Parmesan inspired appetizer, serve these golden wings with a bowl of marinara for dipping.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 pounds chicken wings</li>
    <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon table salt</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon black pepper, divided</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (4 oz.) unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves, minced (about 1 1/2 tbsp.)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
    <li>4 oz parmesan cheese, grated (about 1 cup), divided</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 400°F. Set a wire rack inside 2 rimmed baking sheets.</li>
  <li>Toss together wings, oil, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper in a large bowl to coat. Divide wings between baking sheets, and place in a single layer. Bake in preheated oven until browned and crispy, about 50 minutes, turning halfway through.</li>
  <li>When wings are almost finished cooking, heat butter, garlic, crushed red pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a small saucepan over medium-low until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in 3/4 cup of the Parmesan.</li>
  <li>Remove wings from oven, and immediately transfer to a large bowl. Add garlic butter mixture; toss to coat. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan.</li>
</ol>
